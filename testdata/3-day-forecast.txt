A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Oct 24-Oct 26 2015 is 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Oct 24-Oct 26 2015

            Oct 24     Oct 25     Oct 26
00-03UT        3          5 (G1)     3

21-00UT        5 (G1)     3          2     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 24-25 Oct due to
the anticipated arrival of a coronal mass ejection from 22 Oct.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Oct 24-Oct 26 2015

              Oct 24  Oct 25  Oct 26
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Oct 24-Oct 26 2015

              Oct 24        Oct 25        Oct 26
R1-R2           20%           20%           20%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: No R1 (Minor) or greater radio blackouts are expected.  No
significant active region flare activity is forecast.
